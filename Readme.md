#You Are the Villain

You play as a dungeon boss, prepare yourself for the challenge of the 25 adventurers!

This is my first test entry for LD25… However it seems not possible to finish before the 2 day deadline… Too much distractions during the whole course. Will try to wrap up all the remaining features in the next week.

###Current Features:

- Camera & Control
- Rough Enemy AI
- Rough UI
- Ability Framework

###Missing Features:

- Animations!
- Player Ability Implementation
- Enemy avoidance AI
- Enemy Abilities
